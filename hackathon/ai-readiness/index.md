# AI-Ready Data

For Data to be AI-Ready it generally needs to be described in a machine readable format.

This should address:
- the way by which the data is accessed (API)
- the shape of the data (Objects, Tabular, Files, Images...)
- the context in which the data can be used (license, provenance, usage permissions and restrictions)
