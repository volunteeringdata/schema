### Notes

What properties are required for a volunteering activity?
    An activity MUST have an organisation, a label, and a description.

If an activity has no Location, it is remote?
    An activity with no location might be remote but it is possible that location information is held in the activity's description.

How to know with certainty if an activity is remote?
    An activity accomodates remote participation if the "allows remote participation" property is set to true.


one activity can have multiple location so does each location have a different contact, location can be a wide area (neighbourhood).
What if an activity has different locations depending on the session?
    Then it is a different activity.

Taxonomy must be refined. Concept should have classes: Skills/Requirements, Charitable Aims/Cause, Volunteer Rewards (training, networking, experience, cost reimbursement), Accessibilty, Language, Demographic Targetting.

Organisation must have size.

Contact has Activity, Organisation and Location.

Systems API definitions should be discoverable (do we need a property to link to the API definition).

Time must accomodate repeat (every monday...), there are volunteering roles without clear time constraints and others that are session-based.

Contact is misleading maybe, it seems people think of it as a person rather than as a contact information/line of communication.

We could model it so that an activity has sessions:
with specific times and place and contact



# TODO

how to address digital exclusion?

Contact Alexander Red Cross on emergency and crisis response use case. What data is useful for analysis. Need to know who participated in specific activities and possibly reocurring issues (area prone to flooding) we need someone with some experience to hit the ground running and also new people to keep the response team pool resilient.

Contact Calum SCVO on taxonomies, standardisation, Milo's central volunteering data approach, VMSs relationship to SCVO, the gathering event 11/12th of February, go as a delegate. registry of organisations?


model

roles and skills (emergency response)

events (new year, christmas, big help out, covid)

registry of organisations must be flexible, some charities, other are for profit companies... some small... some spontaneous...



# Balance cost of compute and accuracy of results with structured data

## Add and gather user stories to the repo

## Natural language integration

Spontaneous volunteering (no application/capacity to manage the crisis on side of organisations) vs application

response coordination is cross-organisations

collaborative, open situation report with latest updates.
