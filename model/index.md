title: Volunteering and Social Action Ontology
---

## Introduction

The volunteering and social action ontology can be [visualized through WebVOWL](../webvowl/#opts=doc=0;filter_sco=true;mode_compact=true), a web-based ontology visualization tool.

The volunteering and social action ontology is implemented using RDF, a native data format for the semantic web. RDF enables the [5-star](https://5stardata.info/en/) deployment scheme for Open Data; a scheme suggested by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web and [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) initiator.
